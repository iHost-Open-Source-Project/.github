# Welcome to iHost Open Source Project

iHost is a locally focused smart home gateway designed specifically for home automation. It comes equipped with Zigbee, Matter, Wi-Fi, BLE, Ethernet, microphone, and speaker hardware resources, aiming to deliver a stable, flexible, and reliable local smart home solution.

To better meet user needs and expand ecosystem possibilities, we launched the **iHost Open Source Project**. The goal is to open up the uboot, kernel, and operating system, creating a truly open hardware platform that allows users to freely install any Linux-based system — similar to the experience offered by the Raspberry Pi.

As the first milestone of this initiative, we have released the “HA over iHost” experimental project, which successfully brings the Home Assistant Operating System to iHost, offering users a new way to run HA on local hardware.
